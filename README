Gerrit reports.
Download and query activity data from a [Gerrit code review](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) server, using its API and a local sqlite database.
Publish some reports as informative tables with links, on a MediaWiki wiki page.

Currently tailored for [Wikimedia gerrit](http://gerrit.wikimedia.org/): see [example output on mediawiki.org](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/Reports).

# Requirements

Dependencies:
* Python
** wikitools module (<https://code.google.com/p/python-wikitools/>)

Fill out the gerrit-reports.ini.sample file appropriately and move it to the
equivalent of os.path.expanduser('~') with the name ".gerrit-reports.ini".

You'll need to do a manual one-time run of "create-database.py". All the other
relevant commands are in crontab.txt.

# Other

License information is available in the LICENSE file.

Currently, data updates are not incremental: every update downloads data about all changesets from the API, even though the local database may not need to be updated.

Enjoy!
